Problem 2: Update Linked List Sequence
A linked list is a data structure that allows us to store pieces of data sequentially, similar to a normal list or array. 
The key difference between a linked list and a normal list is how each element is stored in a computerâ€™s memory.
In a normal list, individual elements are stored in adjacent memory locations according to their order in the list. 
If we know where the first element is stored, it's easy to access any other element in the list.
In a linked list, individual elements, called nodes, are not stored in sequential memory locations. Each node may be stored in an 
unrelated memory location. To connect nodes into a sequential list, each node stores a reference or pointer to the next node in the list.
Using the provided Node class and the linked list below, update the current linked list shy_guy -> diddy_kong -> dry_bones to 
shy_guy -> link -> diddy_kong -> toad -> dry_bones.

Problem 9: Convert Singly Linked List to Doubly Linked List
One of the drawbacks of a linked list is that it's difficult to go backwards, because each Node only knows about the Node in front of it.
