Problem 1: Filter Destinations
You're planning an epic trip and have a dictionary of destinations mapped to their respective rating scores. 
Your goal is to visit only the best-rated destinations. Write a function that takes in a dictionary destinations

Problem 3: Secret Beach
You make friends with a local at your latest destination, and they give you a coded message with the name of a secret beach 
most tourists don't know about! You are given the strings key and message which represent a cipher key and a secret message, respectively. 
The steps to decode the message are as follows:
Use the first appearance of all 26 lowercase English letters in key as the order of the substitution table.
Align the substitution table with the regular English alphabet.
Each letter in message is then substituted using the table.
Spaces ' ' are transformed to themselves.
For example, given key = "travel the world" (an actual key would have at least one instance of each letter in the alphabet), we have the partial 
substitution table of ('t' -> 'a', 'r' -> 'b', 'a' -> 'c', 'v' -> 'd', 'e' -> 'e', 'l' -> 'f', 'h' -> 'g', 'w' -> 'h', 'o' -> 'i', 'd' -> 'j').
Write a function decode_message() that accepts the strings key and message and returns a string representing the decoded message.
